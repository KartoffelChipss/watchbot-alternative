At the time of linking the external links, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design of the linked pages. It is not reasonable for the provider to permanently check the external links without concrete indications of legal violations. If violations of the law become known, the external links concerned will be deleted immediately.</p>
